# The wine_snob project

WineSnob - become a wine expert with AI

## Motivation

This project is part of a PaLM API demo. It is designed to demonstrate the ease of building a prompt with MakerSuite and integrating the resulting PaLM API call into Flutter. It does not claim to be a finished product.

[WineSnob](https://winesnob.rozendallabs.org/) is available as a web app. Feel free to try it out.

The project was introduced in a medium article *[With Flutter and PaLM API to Instant Wine Expertise üç∑](https://sylviedie.medium.com/with-flutter-and-palm-api-to-instant-wine-expertise-b8e933e94fc5)*

Several upcoming presentations will discuss the idea and aspects of the implementation with local developer communities:
  * DevFest Mauritius, 28.10.2023,  [slides](TDB), [video](TBD)
  * Droidcon Kenya, 8-10.11.2023, [slides](TDB), [video](TBD)
  * Droidcon Uganda, 11-12.11.2023, [slides](TDB), [video](TBD)
  * Flutterista conference, 11.11.2023,  [slides](TDB), [video](TBD)
  * DevFest Munich, 2.12.2023, [slides](TDB), [video](TBD)

## Code generation

The project uses the [Riverpod code generator](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod_generator). To monitor the source directly and rerun the generator
on chances use

```shell
dart run build_runner watch 
```

## Firebase emulators

In debugging mode, I use the [Firebase emulator suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite).

```shell
firebase emulators:start --import ./data --export-on-exit
```

## Deploy to firebase hosting

Firebase deploy magic builds and deploys the project automatically, but doesn't take extra args.

```shell
firebase deploy
firebase hosting:channel:deploy beta
```

If the indexes have changed on the hosting site it might be a good idea to
run `firebase firestore:indexes` and update the local `firebase.indexes.json`

### Sanity check when formatting a prompt

The prompt data is saved as stringified json in Firestore. It's easy to mess up the formatting when
manipulating strings by hand so I am checking my request strings at [dart.dev](https://dart.dev/) before pasting them
into the Firestore prompt.request field.

Important: make sure description (the interpolated variable) is escaped.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';


void main() {
  const str = '''
  {
    "prompt": {
      "context": "You are a wine expert. You are asked to describe the style and aroma of a particular wine.",
      "examples": [],
      "messages": [
        {
          "content": "Write one paragraph to describe this particular wine: \${description}"
        }
      ]
    },
    "candidate_count": 3,
    "temperature": 0.5
  }
  ''';
  
  print(jsonEncode(jsonDecode(str)));
}
```
